# Documentation

The `docs` folder of our monorepo is the one-stop-shop for all Aurelia documentation. This includes not only documentation on how to use Aurelia (`user-docs`), but also our core engineering docs (`engineering-notes`), detailing how to work on Aurelia. You'll also find other important documents such as our [changelog](CHANGELOG.md), [code-of-conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you'd like to know what projects have inspired us, please check out the [acknowledgements doc](ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md). For information on how you or your company can get technical support, please read our [support doc](SUPPORT.md).
