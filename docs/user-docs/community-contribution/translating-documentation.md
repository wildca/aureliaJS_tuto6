# Translating Documentation

We don't yet have documentation on how best to provide alternate translations of Aurelia's docs. We're currently trying to determine what the best approach would be, especially with respect to keeping alternate translations up to date as the English translations evolve. If you are interested in translating our documentation to other languages, please reach out to us at aurelia@bluespire.com. We'd love to hear from you and would appreciate your input on how best to help you contribute in this way.
