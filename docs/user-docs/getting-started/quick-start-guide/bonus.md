# Beyond the Basics

### Conventions

// TODO: show how conventions work under the hood and how to manually configure components

### Performance

// TODO: show how to switch between getter/setter and proxy modes to optimize around repaint vs. startup perf

### Web Standards

// TODO: add a css file to the todo app and show how shadow dom styles and style sharing "just work". Also explain that CSS Modules support is just a single setting switch.

### Extensibility

// TODO: show how other framework's syntax can be easily "plugged in" to the Aurelia compiler

// TODO: provide a short list of curated plugins that extend Aurelia

### Tooling

// TODO: show how to get the VS Code plugin that provides intellisense; provide an animated gif that shows code complete and goto definition in the context of the todo app
